# Operators
1. Arithmetic

		+ - * / // % **

2. Relational 
	
	Either return True or False
		> < == != >= <= >= 

3. Logical 
		
		and, or, not

4. Bitwise 

		& | ~ ^ >> <<

5. Assignment 

		= += -= *= /= %= //= &= |= ^= >>= <<=

6. Special operators

	identity operator
	
		is, is not

	membership operator

		in, not in

7. Precedence and Associativity 

	Operator Precedence: This is used in an expression with more than one operator with different precedence to determine which operation to perform first.

	Operator Associativity: If an expression contains two or more operators with the same precedence then Operator Associativity is used to determine. It can either be Left to Right or from Right to Left
