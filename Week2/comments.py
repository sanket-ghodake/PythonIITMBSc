Multi Line Comments
Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it

As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.

"Hello \bWorld!" # this is still a comment :)
